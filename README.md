## Streaming Deep RL (wip)

Explorations into the proposed [Streaming Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14606), from University of Alberta

Once completed, if it checks out, will reach to integrate the Stream Q(Î») with [Q-Transformer](https://github.com/lucidrains/q-transformer)
